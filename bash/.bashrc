# Environment Variables
# #####################
# TMP and TEMP are defined in the Windows environment.  Leaving
# them set to the default Windows temporary directory can have
# unexpected consequences.
unset TMP
unset TEMP
# Alternatively, set them to the Cygwin temporary directory
# or to any other tmp directory of your choice
export TMP=/tmp
export TEMP=/tmp
# Or use TMPDIR instead
# export TMPDIR=/tmp
# Shell Options
##############
# See man bash for more options...
#
# Don't wait for job termination notification
# set -o notify
#
# Don't use ^D to exit
# set -o ignoreeof
#
# Use case-insensitive filename globbing
shopt -s nocaseglob
#
# Make bash append rather than overwrite the history on disk
shopt -s histappend
#
# When changing directory small typos can be ignored by bash
# for example, cd /vr/lgo/apaache would find /var/log/apache
shopt -s cdspell

# Completion options
###################
# These completion tuning parameters change the default behavior of bash_completion:
#
# Define to access remotely checked-out files over passwordless ssh for CVS
# COMP_CVS_REMOTE=1
#
# Define to avoid stripping description in --option=description of './configure --help'
# COMP_CONFIGURE_HINTS=1
#
# Define to avoid flattening internal contents of tar files
# COMP_TAR_INTERNAL_PATHS=1
#
# Uncomment to turn on programmable completion enhancements.
# Any completions you add in ~/.bash_completion are sourced last.
# [[ -f /etc/bash_completion ]] && . /etc/bash_completion

# History Options
################
# Don't put duplicate lines in the history.
export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL${HISTCONTROL+,}ignoredups
#
# Ignore some controlling instructions
# HISTIGNORE is a colon-delimited list of patterns which should be excluded.
# The '&' is a special pattern which suppresses duplicate entries.
# export HISTIGNORE=$'[ \t]*:&:[fb]g:exit'
export HISTIGNORE=$'[ \t]*:&:[fb]g:exit:ls' # Ignore the ls command as well
#
# Whenever displaying the prompt, write the previous line to disk
# export PROMPT_COMMAND="history -a"

# Aliases
#
# Some people use a different file for aliases
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
if [ -f "${HOME}/.bash_aliases" ]; then
   . "${HOME}/.bash_aliases"
fi
#

# Umask
#
# /etc/profile sets 022, removing write perms to group + others.
# Set a more restrictive umask: i.e. no exec perms for others:
# umask 027
# Paranoid: neither group nor others have any perms:
# umask 077

# Functions
################
# Some people use a different file for functions
# shellcheck source=/dev/null
